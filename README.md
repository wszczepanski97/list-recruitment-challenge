## Short description

The application is designed to display a list of contacts and the ability to search and mark contacts.

The application was made in **React** with the help of _Typescript, MaterialUI and Vite_.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and any package manager installed
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` in the root of project.
3. Run an app with `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`.

Optionally, you can run the application using the `yarn run dev --host`.
